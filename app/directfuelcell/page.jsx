              Swift Enterprises has invented a number of electrocatalytic systems to
              effectively extract electrical energy from hydrogen peroxideUSP
              7,344,799. When reacted with a high energy protonic fuel such as
              aqueous sodium borohydride, significant power and energy can be
              derived, shown below.

                Work has been proceeding rapidly on the demonstration of a
                technology called the Swift Direct Fuel Cell. The fuel cell uses
                all liquid-phase reactants which are both safe and recyclable. No
                oxygen is needed for operation, making it also suitable for
                underwater and space applications. There has been a significant
                increase in performance based on the development of more selective
                electrocatalysts, higher conductivity ion transfer membranes, and
                the inclusion of novel binders, shown below.

                Swift is using its technology on a NASA Moon to Mars contract
                through Astrobotic Technology. Our charter is to fully develop a
                hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide fuel cell to survive the lunar
                night. Great progress in manufacturing, polymer synthesis and
                electrochemistry is being made on this program.
